The projects have done in this course
The entire course is to design a **Resort website**
The first assessment:

For this assessment, I’ll be producing a [**10-minute video presentation**](https://youtu.be/VtYBawViD2I) and [ppt sides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EOj8ehhruhCC22nraV0sWKkLKA1fv1kD/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105441072140112742344&rtpof=true&sd=true),supported by your speaking & visual aids, that presents the research you gathered from 3 User Tests (Card Sort, Paper Prototype & Aesthetic Prototype).

In-between presenting the research, i reflect on how each prototype evolved based on considerations of the target audience & feedback from peers. These design decisions should justified with the support of scholarly, external sources. A pre-existing website should also serve as an exemplar of these design decisions.

With this video presentation, you’re asked to demonstrate all that you’ve learned & practiced during the design topics of Lectures & Contacts from Weeks 2 to 5:

### Lectures:

**Audience & Content Organisation  ⬥  Prototyping  ⬥  Aesthetics**

### Contacts:

**User Tests: Card Sort  ⬥  User Tests: Paper Prototype  ⬥  User Tests: Aesthetic Prototype**
