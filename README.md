For this assessment, I’ll be producing a **10-minute video presentation**, supported by your speaking & visual aids, that presents the research you gathered from 3 User Tests (Card Sort, Paper Prototype & Aesthetic Prototype).

In-between presenting the research, i reflect on how each prototype evolved based on considerations of the target audience & feedback from peers. These design decisions should justified with the support of scholarly, external sources. A pre-existing website should also serve as an exemplar of these design decisions.

With this video presentation, you’re asked to demonstrate all that you’ve learned & practiced during the design topics of Lectures & Contacts from Weeks 2 to 5:

### Lectures:

**Audience & Content Organisation  ⬥  Prototyping  ⬥  Aesthetics**

### Contacts:

**User Tests: Card Sort  ⬥  User Tests: Paper Prototype  ⬥  User Tests: Aesthetic Prototype**
